# Git Conventional Commits
Repository created to study the pattern of commits using Commitlint, Commitizen, Husky and automatic changelog generation.

## Setup

### 1 - NPM
For the use of this repository we will take into account that you already have **npm** in your environment.

- If you are starting a new repository in your environment, you must run the `git init` command before going to the second topic next step.

### 2 - Install commitilint
To install commitilint just follow the step by step on the [official link](https://commitlint.js.org/#/guides-local-setup "official link").

### 3 - Install commitizen
Run: `npm install -g commitizen`

- After doing this, to make new commits just type in your terminal the command `cz` or `git cz` and you will have a new experience when making commits. Just follow the step by step in the terminal.

### 4 - Generate changelog
I generated the changelog file through an extension for vscode, in [this link](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog "this link") you will find the editors that have this extension available to use.
